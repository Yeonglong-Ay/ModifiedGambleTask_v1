* [Data Analysis Module](#data-analysis-module)
* [Visualization Module](#visualization-module)
* [Main Function](#main-function)

## Task Module

The task module contains functions related to task setup, stimulus presentation, and response collection.

* `task_setup.m`: Initializes task parameters, such as win probability, gamble risk, and trial duration.
* `stimulus_presentation.m`: Presents the stimulus (safe bet or gamble option) to the participant.
* `response_collection.m`: Collects the participant's response (button press or keyboard input).

## Data Analysis Module

The data analysis module contains functions related to data analysis, including time-frequency representation, power modulation analysis, and regression analysis.

* `time_frequency_analysis.m`: Performs time-frequency analysis on the electrophysiological data.
* `power_modulation_analysis.m`: Analyzes power modulations in different frequency bands.
* `regression_analysis.m`: Performs regression analysis on the behavioral and electrophysiological data.

## Visualization Module

The visualization module contains functions related to visualization, including plot generation and heatmap creation.

* `plot_results.m`: Generates plots of the results, including time-frequency representations and power modulation analyses.

## Main Function

The main function coordinates the execution of the task, data analysis, and visualization.

* `main.m`: Calls the task setup, stimulus presentation, response collection, data analysis, and visualization functions.

## Requirements

* Psychtoolbox
* MATLAB
* GitHub
